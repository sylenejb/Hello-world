## Project Title
"My sample, Hello world, is my first repository!"

## What was the project
This project is me preaticing how to use GitHub for the first time. From this I learned to do a repository and change my profile. 

## How can GitHub help me
GitHub can help me build a portfolio of my work as an analytics student. I hope to begin working on my own projects outside of class to show what I can achieve and post them on GitHub as well.
